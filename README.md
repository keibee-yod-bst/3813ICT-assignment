# Chat Application with Video, Image Upload, and MongoDB Support  
**3813ICT Software Frameworks**  
**s5270448 Kei Giliam**

This is a real-time chat application developed as part of the 3813ICT Assignment Phase 2. It includes MongoDB integration, video chat with PeerJS, image uploads, and socket-based real-time messaging.

---

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a chat system with advanced features such as real-time messaging using **WebSockets**, **video chat** using **PeerJS**, **image uploads**, and **MongoDB** integration for persistent data storage.

This chat application allows users to:
- Register, log in, and update profile pictures.
- Join chat channels and send text or image messages.
- Initiate video calls with online users.

---

## Git Usage & Structure
- **Repository Structure**:
  - The repository is divided into client-side (Angular) and server-side (Node.js) codebases.
  - Frequent commits reflect new features and bug fixes, tracked via branches (e.g., `feature/chat`, `feature/video-call`).
  - Pull requests and merging strategies are used for integrating features.
  - A `README.md` provides project installation instructions.
  - GitHub is used to collaborate and keep version control organized.

## Data Structures

### 1. Users Collection:
```json
{
  "_id": "abc123",
  "username": "User1",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "groups": ["general", "random"],
  "profileImage": "/uploads/profile1.jpg"
}
```

### 2. Groups Collection:
```json
{
  "_id": "group1",
  "name": "General",
  "channels": ["general-chat", "random-chat"]
}
```

### 3. Channels Collection:
```json
{
  "_id": "general-chat",
  "name": "General Chat",
  "group": "group1",
  "messages": []
}
```

### 4. Messages Collection:
```json
{
  "_id": "msg123",
  "username": "User1",
  "message": "Hello, world!",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-17T00:00:00Z",
  "isImage": false
}
```

## Client-Server Responsibility Breakdown

### Client (Angular):
- Components handle the user interface and interactions.
- Services interact with the backend API and handle real-time socket connections.
- Image uploads and chat messages are handled through HTTP requests to the server.
- PeerJS is used on the client-side for initiating and receiving video calls.

### Server (Node.js with MongoDB):
- The backend stores user, group, channel, and message data in MongoDB collections.
- Routes are exposed as REST APIs to manage users, channels, and groups.
- Sockets are used to support real-time chat and notifications.
- PeerJS server manages video call signaling.

## Routes & APIs

| Route                   | Method | Parameters                | Description                         |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| /register               | POST   | { username, password }    | Register a new user.               |
| /login                  | POST   | { username, password }    | Login and generate a token.        |
| /channels               | GET    | None                      | Retrieve all channels.             |
| /channels/:id/messages  | GET    | { id }                    | Get all messages from a channel.   |
| /upload-profile         | POST   | FormData with profile image | Upload a user's profile image.   |
| /upload-chat-image      | POST   | FormData with chat image  | Upload a chat image as a message.  |

## Angular Architecture

1. **Components**:
   - `LoginComponent`: Handles user login.
   - `RegisterComponent`: Handles new user registration.
   - `ChatComponent`: Manages chat, video, and image interactions.
   - `ChannelComponent`: Displays the available channels.
   - `ProfileComponent`: Allows users to update their profile.

2. **Services**:
   - `AuthService`: Manages authentication and token storage.
   - `ChatService`: Handles socket communication and API interactions.

---

## Real-time Interaction with Sockets
- **Socket.IO** is used to manage real-time chat.
- When a user joins a channel, a notification is sent to other users in the channel.
- As new messages arrive, the chat history is instantly updated via sockets.
- When a user leaves, their status is updated in real-time.

---

## PeerJS Video Chat Integration

### 1. Client-side setup:
- PeerJS is initialized in the `ChatComponent`.
- Each user gets a unique peer ID upon connection, shared with others through the server.
- Users can initiate a call by clicking on another userâ€™s video call button.

### 2. Server-side PeerJS Setup:
```bash
npx peerjs --port 8080
```
This server handles the signaling for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connections.

### 3. Functionality:
- Once connected, both users can exchange video streams.
- Video streams are displayed in the `caller-video` element in the chat interface.

---

## Image Uploads in Chat

### 1. How it works:
- Users can upload images as part of their chat messages.
- The uploaded image files are stored on the server under the `/uploads` directory.

### 2. Image Storage & Retrieval:
- File paths (e.g., `/uploads/chat-image.jpg`) are stored in MongoDB.
- When a user sends an image message, the image URL is sent to all users through the socket.

### 3. Image Upload Example (ChatComponent):
```typescript
uploadImage(event: any) {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('chatImage', file);

  this.chatService.uploadChatImage(formData).subscribe(
    () => console.log('Image uploaded successfully'),
    (error) => console.error('Failed to upload image:', error)
  );
}
```

---

## Testing

### 1. Backend Tests (Jest):
- Unit tests are implemented to verify API routes and data storage.

Example:
```javascript
test('POST /register creates a new user', async () => {
  const res = await request(app).post('/register').send({ username: 'user', password: 'pass' });
  expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
});
```

### 2. Frontend Unit Tests (Karma):
- Components are tested to ensure form validation and button states.

Example:
```typescript
it('should disable the register button if form is invalid', () => {
  component.user.username = '';
  component.user.password = '';
  fixture.detectChanges();
  expect(fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('button').disabled).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Cypress):
- Tests to verify user flows, such as login, registration, and chat.

Example:
```javascript
describe('Login Page', () => {
  it('should log the user in and redirect to profile', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');F
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password');
    cy.get('button').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/profile');
  });
});
```

## Conclusion
This chat application integrates:
- **MongoDB** for persistent data storage (users, channels, and messages).
- **Socket.IO** for real-time chat functionality.
- **PeerJS** for video chat between users.
- **Image uploads** for both profile pictures and chat messages.
- **Comprehensive testing** through unit, backend, and E2E tests.
- **Proper version control** using Git to track development progress.

This project demonstrates the combination of real-time communication, multimedia support, and a scalable backend.
